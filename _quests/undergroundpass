<h4>The Three Paladins</h4>
The first enemies to defeat are Sir Carl, Sir Jerro and Sir Harry, as you need the badges they drop. Poison and recoil work fine.

<h4>The three demons</h4>
The next three enemies to defeat are three demons named Doomion, Othainian and Holthion. Again, poison and recoil work fine.

<h4>The big spider</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-8">
    Next up is a big spider, Kalrag. Once again, poison and recoil. After defeating it the other (small) spiders will attack you, just ignore them and run away.

<h4>Zamorak robes</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-8">
    For the final part of the quest, you will need a set of Zamorak robes. You can kill a Disciple of Iban for them inside the underground pass (recoil and poison, as per usual), though it is possible to bring robes obtained beforehand.
