<h4>Demigod</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-8">
    You will have to fight one of four desert demigods, depending on which canopic jar you have: Apmeken, Crondis, Het or Scabaras. They can be dispatched easily with recoil and poison. However, they will despawn rather quickly, so if you cannot deal damage fast enough it may be necessary to use a Deathtouched Dart instead.

<h4>Possessed Priest</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-8">
    The final enemy is a possessed priest. He can be defeated with the same methods as the demigods. Luckily, he has much less LP, so a Deathtouched Dart shouldn't be necessary.
