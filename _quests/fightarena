<h4>More battles</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-4">
    After talking to Hengrad in your cell, you will have to fight two enemies back-to-back: a Khazard Scorpion and Bouncer. Recoil and poison work for both.
    Once Bouncer is dead, General Khazard will attack you, but you can simply run away.
