<h4>Nezikchened: first fight</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-4">
    At the start of the first fight, Nezikchened will drain your prayer. Kill him with recoil and poison. You must kill him fast enough, however, or he will despawn.

<h4>Three guardians</h4>
<p>To go deeper in the cave, you will have to defeat Ranalph Devere, Irvig Senay and San Tojalon. Recoil and poison.</p>

<h4>Nezikchened: second and thirdfight</h4>
<p>Before the second fight, follow the "long and easy path", which means you do <b>not</b> kill Viyeldi. The fight is identical to the first, except that your prayer will not be drained.</p>
<p>The third fight is again similar, but at the start of the fight Nezikchened will be able to hit you a few times while you cannot do anything. This is incredibly dangerous for HCIM, so prepare accordingly and activate Protect from Melee <b>before</b> using the new totem on the old one.</p>
