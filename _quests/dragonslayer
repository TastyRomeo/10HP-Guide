<h4>Lozar's Map Piece</h4>
When trying to obtain Lozar's map piece, you will have to deal with Wormbrain. Simply pay him 10,000 Coins for the map piece to avoid any combat.
<hr>
<h4>Melzar's Map Piece</h4>
Obtaining Melzar's map piece means you have to go through Melzar's Maze. Only specific pre-determined monsters drop keys:
<ul>
  <li>the small Zombie Rat with a long tail,</li>
  <li>the Ghost with a hood, no cape, and a single tendril coming out of each shoulder,</li>
  <li>the Skeleton with a tiny round shield,</li>
  <li>one of two indistinguishable Zombies,</li>
  <li>Melzar the Mad,</li>
  <li>a Lesser Demon.</li>
</ul>
Each of these can be TFK'd for the key drop.

<h4>Elvarg</h4>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-8">
    Elvarg is a very tough green dragon. Her dragonfire will always very quickly drain your prayer points, and if not protected against, will also quickly drain all your combat stats. Even with dragonfire protection, the breath can hit 1,000 - 1,500 typeless damage which cannot be recoiled. Her melee attack is marginally weaker but can be recoiled. Using some form of life-point boosting is therefore heavily recommended.
    <br /><br />
    Luckily, Elvarg does not give Combat XP when killed, allowing you to fight her normally instead of having to recoil 10,000 LP.
